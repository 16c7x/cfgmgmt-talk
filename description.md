# Summary

## Abstract

You’ve been using Puppet to manage your infrastructure, but no one really told you about best practices and now you feel like your code is fragile and you’re worried that the next change could break something.

## Description

Puppet best practices, patterns such as roles and profiles, and moving your configuration data to Hiera will organize your configuration management into a clear and robust structure that will give you confidence to make the required changes as and when they are needed as your infrastructure grows.
